# Wikipedia Text Summarizer

This Python script allows you to fetch and summarize content from Wikipedia articles using the Wikipedia API and the BERT Extractive Summarizer. It also saves the fetched text and the generated summary to separate text files.

Please be nice to wikipedia and me, as the code uses their free API, and an agent with my email specified. If you want to run the code, please modify it with your own information in the custom user agent variable.

## Usage
